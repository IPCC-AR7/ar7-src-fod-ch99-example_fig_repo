# Data directory

This is where data required to create figure is stored. Create a subdirectory for each dataset, and for each add a 
`source` entry to `info.yml` including the name of the dataset, the directory path and the DOI where this data can be 
accessed.

Include any additional instruction on accessing data in this README.
